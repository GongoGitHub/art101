					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to create variables to hold data about our personal cars 
						in the JavaScript console in our local browser. Then, in VScode, we declared
						all the same variables we created in the console within the JavaScript file 
						for the purpose of this lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not so much a problem, but mor eof a syntax convention that we missed a lot.
						We forgot  lot to use a semicolon at the end of each line. As for my own problems,
						getting my image to work correctly took a bit of troubleshooting, but I got it to work.
						Overall this lab was pretty straightforward. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a fun and simple introduction to JavaScript and making and using variables, 
						both within the console and in VScode, as well as combining this knowledge with our 
						current HTML and CSS knowledge </p>
