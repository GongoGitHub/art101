					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> This lab challenegd us to experiemtn with DOM manipulation.
						We created a lab10 index.html, css and js folders in VScode
						We created a button and assigned random text for the button to
						generate when clicked on </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Getting the button working was very hard. At first they weren't working 
						as intended, such as only appearing when the page was refreshes. We had to turn 
						to google eventually, and we got it working, but generated a list rather than replacing
						the old generated text
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall this lab was pretty fun, despite the bumps we had with it.
						It was fun to be creative with the buttons and experiment.
					</p>
			</div>

					<h2> Results</h2>
					<p> The button now generates a random color </p>
