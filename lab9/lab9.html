					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to add buttons to our HTML webpage
						using what we learned in lecture and jQuery
						<button id="blue-button">Click Here</button>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This lab was a lot harder than previous labs. The buttons would not appear,
						and after some troublshooting, I found that we needed the "$" in front of 
						a lot of our code. Overall very challenging and required a lot of debugging. 
						I also don't think the colors work right through github, idk what to do to fix that
						<button id="green-button">Click Here</button>
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Despite this being a pretty tough lab, I'm happy that I got my code working
						after troubleshooting problems for a while
						<button id="purple-button">Click Here</button>
