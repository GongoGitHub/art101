			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a local file structure on my system, create and customize
						a homepage, introduction, and links to my other labs.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The biggest challenge for me personally was getting the changes to actually show throught the website link on GitHub.
						It was working fine at the beginning, but once I started editing things and making changes, it no longer worked properly.
						I think it must have something to do with naming conventions, but im not sure... I got it to work but nwo the only issue
						that persists is i cant make my profile pic smaller, so I'll figure that out another time and continue forward for now
					 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this assignment was not the easiest for me, both content wise and actually putting the work in to do it.
						Given that we missed a lecture and have been a bit behind, I didn't realize the due dates shifted a bit and have gotten
						behind myself. On top of other classes' big projects and my job, I've been struggling to time manage the last few things
						for this course, so hopefully I can catch up this week. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> During this lab i edited the CSS and HTML content for my homepage, as well as added a profile picture for myself, and set up
						links to other labs and content. However, chanign the size of my pofile pic still nees to be fixed; I will revisit this soon 
						as I need to submit this ASAP
