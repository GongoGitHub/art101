			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us to make a function that depends on conditionals.
						In this case, we created a function that sorted the users input into one of four Hogwarts houses
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This lab was mostly straightforward for us, only running into a few synax issues
						along the way. Otherwise it was pretty much fine for us
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall this lab was pretty enjoyable. There wasn't a whoe lot to learn,
						as it was mostly just applying and adding on to the things we learned in some of
						the previous labs. Plus this stuff will be helpful in our groups final project.
					</p>
