					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi, my name is Sam! I'm currently a Junior here at UCSC and majoring in AGPM. I'm taking this class to get a bit
						more comfortable with coding and the challenges that come with it. Hopefully at some point I can apply what I
						learn in this course to some of my future game design endeavors.
						In my free time I really enjoy playing games of all sorts. Board games, video games, you name it. I also am
						totally hooked on Warhammer 40k as a hobby, both modeling + painting and the tabletop gaming aspect of it.
						Random fun fact about me: I currently work at the Trader Joes in downtown Santa Cruz, come say hi! :D
					</p>
