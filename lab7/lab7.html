					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged us create a new javascript file 
                        that would prompt the user to enter a username, 
                        then neatly sort the username's characters, returning the result. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When fist creating the functions, I named some of the strings were incorrectly,
                        and a few of the functions I tried to call were not in the right order. 
                        After a little fiddling I got the output to display on my website lab page.
                        Additionally, at first I thought the output was wrong, 
                        and thought it would give me something like: "x," "x," "x," "x," "x,",
                        but then realized the assignment was to simply sort and reorder the entered username.
                    </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this lab didn't take too long, but I started to have more issues
                        with this one compared to the last. It was a lot of repetition in syntax
                        and I needed to make sure the functions were properly ordered.
                    </p>
